        <center><h1>Infantilization of young adults</h1></center>
        <p>Teens face tonnes of problems in the society, as well as mentally.
            The society is also a huge challenge for the teens because they face mental
            pressure due to the society. This is evident as there are many cases that resulted
            in suicides of teens. This blog is written for parents to understand the serious issues
            and find the solutions to tackle them.

            The main problem that a teen faces is infantilization. The term infantilization means
            treating a matured teen as a child. This type of treatment is common among all families
            (there are some exceptions). The parents and the society prohibit the teens from making
            their own decisions, and their opinion is never heard. Teenagers can have 
            some very important opinions and they are overpowered by the society that thinks
            teens are "just kids", they don't know anything.

    This is a very significant problem that affects the teenagers. This huge mistake
    caused by the society, makes a teen depressed and he/she won't have anyone to 
    share his/her opinions. 
     
    To prevent depression among teens, it's mandatory for the parents to value their
    child's opinions, talk with them and only convince the teens, to change their decisions
    when they are on a wrong pathway. To accomplish this, the parents have to spend time
                                                      with their children.

    The next solution is to stop spoon feeding. This is significantly important because 
    preparing the teens for their future is very important. Teach them the ways to tackle 
    problems instead of you solving them. If parents fail to do so, then the teens will
    suffer in the future.

    You need not worry now, because you have more time to sit with your child, and build 
    confidence inside them to explore the world. The most important point of all is to hear
    your child's opinions. These are the small but majestic solutions to prevent depression
    of teenagers and to prepare them for the future.
